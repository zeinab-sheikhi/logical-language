# Propositional Logic 
This repository contains Python implementations of the Propositional Logic and First Order Logic.\n
In Propositional Logic, a model is simply an interpretation function.\n
An interpretation function is a function that sends each propositional letter to a boolean value.\n
In this repository, strings are used to represent propositional letters.\n
To compute which interpretation functions (i.e. models) make true a given formula, we are going to use partial interpretation functions.\n
We use a partial interpretation function to represent the conditions that are minimally sufficient to make a given formula true (or false). A list of such functions represents a disjunction of conditions. We use such a list to represent the necessary and sufficient conditions to make a given formula true (or false).\n
